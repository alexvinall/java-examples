# java-examples

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexvinall/java-examples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexvinall/java-examples)

**Examples of Java solutions to common coding puzzles and problems.**

*Partly because it's fun to brush up on these things, and partly to learn IntelliJ, coming from an Eclipse background.
Built with Maven, CI via travis.*
